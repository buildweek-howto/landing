            Just like you can train your body to run an 8-minute mile or do a
            perfect squat, you can train your mind to remember things more
            efficiently. Learning new skills – especially when you share that
            knowledge with others – helps flex your memory muscles. The simple
            act of learning something new, and then repeating it, helps improve
            your overall recall.
